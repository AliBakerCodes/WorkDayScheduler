It will then be preseneted if the page refreshes. When the user clicks "Copy," the text for the task will be copied to the clipboard. When the user clicks "Clear," the task will be cleared from the hour block, but WILL NOT BE SAVED unless the user clicks "Save." The current date and time are displayed in the hero section. For hours of the current day that are in the past, the rows will be a gray color. The current hour will be a red color. Future hours will be a green color.
